# CS181-P4 - Reinforcement learning with Swingy Monkey

This repository documents the work completed by Matthew Stewart, Claire Stolz, and Shane Ong for the final practical of CS181: Machine Learning, involving the application of reinforcement learning to the flappy bird-style game 'Swingy Monkey'.

In this documentation we outline the methods used to attain the highest possible score on the game by using Q-learning and its deep learning-based extensions, commonly referred to as DQN (Deep Q-Learning) and DDQN (Double Deep Q-Learning).
